The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp Coursework by Colt Steele/n/n

Using course to familiarize myself Python 3 after being primarily a .NET dev. Also first time using Linux for any length of time

Section 1 - Course Introduction /n
Section 2 - MAC/LINUX Command Line Fundamentals /n
Section 4 - MAC Python Setup/n/n

Day 1 thoughts: Made incorrect assumption that Linux setup would be the same. Ended up having to refresh OS after trying to update Linux to latest version. What I Learned: Trust the repos

Section 6 - Numbers, Operators, and Comments /n
Section 7 - Variables and Strings/n/n

Day 2 thoughts: Fairly basic after being in a dev role for the past few years, but going back to basics to really let syntax sink in and to gain confidence in a new language while it's just a personal endeavor.  Dynamic Typing is also pretty interesting coming from a mainly C#/Java/C++ background (C# mainly)
